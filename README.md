# FAIR Training Working Group

To be able to implement FAIR principles in Training we want to establish a Working Group (with members both from within ELIXIR as well as external to ELIXIR). The first discussion about Training & FAIR took place at the workshop at the AHM in Berlin.

There are two main tasks related to FAIR & Training:

- **FAIRification of Training Materials and Courses**:
An important part of this is developing the FAIR metrics for Training. This will be done in close collaboration with the FAIR metrics group.
- **Training Scientists in working with and implementing the FAIR principles**:
A subset of this will  need to involve training instructors to teach this to the users.
